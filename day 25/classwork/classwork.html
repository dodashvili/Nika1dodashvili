    <p>World War I[j] or the First World War (28 July 1914 â€“ 11 November 1918) was a global <br>
         conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Central Powers. Fighting took place throughout <br>
          Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. <br>
           One of the deadliest wars in history, it resulted in an estimated 9 <br>
            million soldiers dead and 23 million wounded, plus up to 8 million civilian <br>
             deaths from numerous causes including genocide. 
         The movement of large numbers of troops and civilians during the war was a <br> major factor in spreading the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. <br>

        increasing diplomatic tensions between the European great powers <br>
         reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named <br>
          Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the <br>
           Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and <br>
            declared war on 28 July. Russia came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, <br>
             Germany, France, and Britain were drawn into the war, with the Ottoman Empire <br>
              joining in November of the same year. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to first <br>
               defeat France, then transfer forces to the Russian front. However, this <br>
                failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous <br>
                 line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern <br>
                  Front was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite <br>
                   costly offensives. As the war expanded to more fronts, Bulgaria, Italy, Romania, Greece <br> and others joined in from 1915 onward.
