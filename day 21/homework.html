<h1> world war II</h1>
<p>World War II or the Second World War 
(1 September 1939 2 September 1945)
was a global conflict between two major alliances:the Allies and the Axis powers.
The vast majority of the world's countries, including all the great powers,
fought as part of these military alliances. </p>
<p> Many participating countries invested all available economic,
industrial, and scientific capabilities into this total war, 
blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources.    </p>
<p> Aircraft played a major role,
enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of
the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.
It was by far the deadliest conflict in history,
resulting in 70 85 million fatalities.</p>
